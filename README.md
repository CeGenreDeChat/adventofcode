# Description

This github repository is intended to store all my actions related to the “aventofcode” event. The adventure is detailed on my personal website.

## Organization of the github repository.

To make it easier for me to test different algorithms, I've moved all the puzzles into subdirectories that are called directly from the root main. I'm doing a lot of experimentation, so main.go may be in draft form.

## Useless functions

For the first two puzzles, I tried to create general functions, but quickly realized that it was easier to start from scratch. Apart from algorithms such as BFS and Dijkstra, it's not worth the trouble. However, having spent some time coding them, I'll leave them here just in case.
